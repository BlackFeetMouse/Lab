Talked about explorative study based on one specific NBA Game and visualization system interface design.

Points:
- Look for NBA data API (Json..) or refined data source
  - Two excel sheets firt (Box Score Data and PBP Data)
- Revise the combined game summary
  - Try to contain every interviewee's idea 
  - Give refernce of whose idea on the summary list
- Math formula explore for NLP part(Extreme Value / Outlier)
- Visualization Interface should enable users to explore games first and then let them focus on specific team or game
  - Overview first -> Filter -> Specific game
  - Show season ranking at the index page is one way, then choose one specific team
  - Canlander is not good since the index page jumped to specific game directly in this way without any exploration
- Interaction and Vis Part
  - Box Score Data and PBP Data might can be combined together
  - When mouse is hovering on one player in the text, his related parts in data table are highlighted
