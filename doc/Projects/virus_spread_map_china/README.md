# 2019-nCov Virus Spreading Visualization

## Background

A new coronvirus, designated 2019-nCov, was identified in late 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province. The virus kept spreading and this serious coronavirus outbreak 
has killsed at least 259 people and infected close to 12,000 people gloablly by Feb 1, 2020. For more details, please check [Center for Disease Control and Prevention Website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/summary.html)

## Introduction

This visualization project gives an interactive Chinese map that visulizes the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak in China with real time data. The color of areas 
indicates the seriousness of virus spreading condition. Color from white to red indicate the seriouness from normal to serious.

## Data

Thanks to [BlankerL's project](https://github.com/BlankerL/DXY-2019-nCoV-Crawler) which offers real time 2019-nCov spreading data API. The original real time data comes from [丁香园](https://ncov.dxy.cn/ncovh5/view/pneumonia)

## Language 

Python(Bokeh for visualization)

## Furture Work

For future work, I want to add each province's city condition and global virus spreading condition. 

Besides, I would like to add temporal line chart which can predict the furture increasing rate of virus spreading.

***All best wishes. Hope everything will be fine soon.***
