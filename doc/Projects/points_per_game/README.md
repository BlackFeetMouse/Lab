## NBA 2019-2020 Season Top20 players for PTS(Points Per Game)

- The python file points_per_game.py can create the graph which visualizes the top20 players for PTS in season 2019-2020.
- Data(PTS, Player Name, Player Profile Picture..) is extracted directly from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/trb_career.html). Therefore, the graph will change in terms of each player's daily update on the website.
- The graph is created by Python Bokeh.
