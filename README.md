## Language - Python/JavaScript
- Python 

- JavaScript

JavaScript provides many libraries that were designed for specific types of visualizations. D3.js is not a tool for creating predefined types of charts and visualizations. Instead, it is a library to help you create any visualization, including custom and unique presentations.

**Environment Setup on D3.js**

D3.js doesn't depend on any other libraries, and it's available on most CDNs. All we need to do is include it in the page.
```javascript
