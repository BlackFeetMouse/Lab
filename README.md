Sport Visualisation

## Language - JavaScript

JavaScript provides many libraries that were designed for specific types of visualizations. D3.js is not a tool for creating predefined types of charts and visualizations. Instead, it is a library to help you create any visualization, including custom and unique presentations.
### Environment Setup on D3.js
D3.js doesn't depend on any other libraries, and it's available on most CDNs. All we need to do is include it in the page.
```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">
   <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title></title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/3.4.6/d3.min.js"></script>
      <script>
      
      </script>
   </body>
</html>
```
