- Good teams show up in the upper right quadrant.
- Poor teams show up in the lower left quadrant.
- Teams with good defense and poor offense show up in the upper left quadrant.
- Teams with good offense and poor defense show up in the lower right quadrant.

### Data is extracted from [NBAstuffer](https://www.nbastuffer.com/2019-2020-nba-team-stats/) directly. Then the graph will change in terms of each team's daily power report.
