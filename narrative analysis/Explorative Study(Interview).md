## Participants' game summaries

### Participant Michael:
>Mavericks finished Los Angeles Lakers’ 10-game winning streak with a 114-100 victory.
>Mavs’ Doncic and Lakers’ Davis had the highest 27 points following by Lakers’ Lebron with 25 points. Doncic had the highest 10 assists among two teams. Both of the lead players in two teams (Lebron and Doncic) had a high number of turnovers. Kuzma, one of Lakers’ lead bench players had a super low field-goal-percentage of 12.5% with 21 minutes on-court time.
>
>Comparing with Mavs’ 17 three-pointers, Lakers only accomplished 7 three-pointers out of 27 attempts. Besides, Mavs had 16 offensive rebounds while Lakers only had 9. Perhaps these flaws lead Lakers towards the loss. 

Characteristics:
- Summarize the data starting from the match score and maximum individuals' score, assist and rebound. 
- Lead players’ analysis and bench players’ analysis.
- Later summarize team performance analysis and potential loss/win causality.

### Participant Hukai:
>People usually make some comparisons between Lebron and Doncic in terms of their on-court performances. 
>In this game, comparing with Lebron, Doncic had a better three-pointer performance and Doncic’s more positive impact lead the team to victory. 
>Green and Kuzma had a low field-goal-percentage.
>

Characteristics:
- Summarize starting from the comparison of lead players of both teams.
- List some players’ abnormal performances.
- Give the comparison of team performances.

### Participant Xiangyu:
>First of all, the most direct manifestation of Lakers' 14 points loss by Mavs is the three-point field goals and the three-point field goal percentage. In the case that the field-goal percentage and the number of field goals are very close, Lakers had 10 fewer three-pointers and 10 percentage lower three-point field goal percentage, which directly caused the difference of the final score. At the same time, limiting the opponent's three-pointers has always been a weakness of Lakers. This game is still not good. In this season Lakers has a top-level center players configuration, but Lakers lost a lot of offensive rebounds in this game. It seems, after a 10-game winning streak, Lakers relaxed their will to this game. Besides, the score from Mavs’ bench players is much more than that from Lakers, which caused Lakers to overly reply on the lead players and finally ended up with loss.
>
>The lead players of both sides have remained high-level performances in this game. Doncic had the highest assists and rebounds of the team. Lebron and Davis also got high assists and rebounds. However, James played the second-lowest plus-minus value in the game. 

Characteristics:

- Starting from the match score and match loss/win analysis. 
- Give the potential loss/win causality. 
- Then, give the comparison of lead players of both teams.

### Participants Shangguan: 
>Mavs beat Lakers with a big score gap 114-100. 
>
>In terms of team offense, the field goal attempts and field-goal percentage of two teams are similar, but, comparing with Mavs’ 17 three-pointers out of 49 attempts, Lakers only accomplished 7 three-pointers out of 27 attempts. Lakers’ offense focused on two-pointers with low three-point field goal attempts and three-point field goal percentage. Besides, Lakers had a bad perimeter defense towards Mavs.
>
