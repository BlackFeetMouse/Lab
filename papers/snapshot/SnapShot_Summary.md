# SnapShot 
Hannah Pileggi, John T. Stasko

## Why wrote this paper

In cooperation with professional hockey analysts, the author began to explore whether visualization could be advantageous for competitive hockey strategy. Visualization could integrate into analyst's workflow of 1. Exploration 2. Discussion 3.Presentation.

For these three tasks, they designed Snap Shot visualization system for exploring, discussion, and presenting hypotheses and findings using National Hockey League shot data.

## Main contributions 
1. A model workflow of a sports analyst 
2. SnapShot System for visualizing National Hockey League shot data
3. Threr case studies for evaluation

## Three techneques 
- <b>Shot Map</b> which primarily highlights shot location and secondarily the shot/goal, home/away, and shooter team distinctions.
- <b>Traditional Heap Map</b> which is designed primarily to highlight patterns of  shot location density.
- <b>Radial Heat Map</b> which conveies information about shot length, the statistic identified as most interesting by the analysts. 

## Evaluations

1. The first analyst was investgating shot lengths. From Radial Heat Map system, he said it was clear to see NYR (New York Madison Square Garden) is different from other rinks
2. The second analyst used Radial Heat Map to find out whether "Animals defend their home" theory. After observing home teams' and away teams' visualizations, we noticed that away teams have more shots (darker color in 30-foot shooting area) and home team tend to have more 50-foot shots than away teams. However, according to the goal visualizations, home team and away team appeared to be identical. Therefore, the analyst had the theory that "They are shooting differently at home but they are not scoring differently"
3. The third analyst was curious about whether it will be easier to get points from the right side of the goalkeepers since the goalkeeper usually have the stick in their right hand and glove in their left hand. However, the Shot Map visualization presented that the results are nearly same at left sides and right sides.
